    "in mind, but now with $J<0$. Go to the 2D database at https://cmrdb.fysik.dtu.dk/?project=c2db and search for VI$_2$ in the CdI$_2$ prototype. Click on the *ferromagnetic* structure and download the .xyz file. Since we will need to do LDA calculations later on, we start by relaxing the structure with the LDA functional. We will be interested in the anti-ferromagnetic state later, but perform the relaxation in the ferromagnetic state, which has a smaller unit cell. Fill in the missing pieces and run the cell below. V has the electronic configuration [Ar]3d$^3$4s$^2$, which can be used to guess the initial magnetic moments. The calculation takes about 17 minutes.\n"

    "Note that we switch off symmetry in the end of the script and do a last calculations with all $k$-points in the Brillouin zone. This is because spinors transform in a non-trivial way and the spin-orbit coupling can be obtained from the irreducible $k$-points without transforming the wavefunctions at symmetry related $k$-points. Evaluate the magnetic anisotropy in the cell below in a manner similar to the case of CrI$_3$. Is the easy-axis in plane or out of plane? Do you expect to find a finite critical temperature based on this?"

The anti-ferromagnetic structure we obtained must thus be frustrated and possibly not the true ground state.\n",

Write some python code in the cell below that return $J$ and $A$ based on the non-collinear calculation. The calculation of $J$ requires two spin configurations and we could use the ferromagnetic calculation in the simple unit cell obtained at the top of the notebook as one of them. But, since the energy differences are rather small it is much better if you can obtain a ferromagnetic state with the same unit cell and parameters as we used for the non-collinear calculation. You may thus run the cell above once more, but with ferromagnetic alignment."
