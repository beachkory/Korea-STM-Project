    "In 2017, ferromagnetic order was observed in a monolayer of CrI$_3$ below 45 K (*Nature* **546** 270 (2017)). It comprises the first demonstration of magnetic order in a 2D material and has received a lot of attention due to the peculiar properties of magnetism in 2D. The physics of magnetic order in 2D is rather different than in 3D and in order to understand what is going on we will need to introduce a bit of theory. But before we get to that let us get started with the calculations."

    "You should obtain a value of $T_c$, which is on the order of 100 K. This is much larger than the experimental value.  However in 2D materials mean-field theory fails miserably and the result cannot be trusted. In fact, at finite temperatures the Heisenberg model stated above does not exhibit magnetic order in 2D. The reason is that entropy tends to dominate over internal energy in 2D, such that the free energy is always minimized by disordered configurations at finite temperatures. This is the content of the Mermin-Wagner theorem which states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Continuous symmetries cannot be spontaneously broken at finite temperature in systems with short-range interactions in dimensions $d\\le2$*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heisenberg model above has a continuous rotational symmetry of the spins and magnetic order is obtained by choosing a certain direction for all the spins. This is known as a spontaneously broken symmetry, because the magnetically ordered state has broken the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The direction of magnetization is arbitrary and can be rotated at no energy cost, but the spins are aligned with respect to each other and the system is therefore magnetically ordered. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Heisenberg model it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic excitations in the spin-wave approximation, which yields the dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\varepsilon(q)=aq^2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Show that the integral diverges for $d\\le2$ in the lower limit. (Hint you should start by calculating $g(\\varepsilon)$. If you do not remember how to do that we give it here: $g(\\varepsilon)=b\\varepsilon^{(d-2)/2}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence of the integral in $d\\le2$ signals that the ground state is unstable and comprises an example of the Mermin-Wagner theorem: in $d\\le2$, the free energy is always dominated by entropy at finite temperatures and magnetic order cannot be maintained if a material has rotational symmetry of the spins. The instability in 2D is closely related to the vanishing energy of magnetic excitations in the limit of $q\\rightarrow0$, which is a consequence of the rotational symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnetic anisotropy\n",
    "The consequence of the Mermin Wagner theorem is that magnetic order in 2D is only possible if the rotational symmetry of the spins is *explicitly broken*. That is, there must be an additional term in the Hamiltonian that breaks the symmetry. Such a term can be provided by spin-orbit coupling which couples the spin to the lattice through the electronic orbitals.\n",
